To make the 2D limit plots you do

 python plot_2D.py -n 12 --LHC 13 --ch 1 --type 1

Where:

-n 12 
  is the number of clusters
  (you should always use 12)

—LHC 13
  Is the CM energy (It is going to be used for the cross section normalization)

—ch is the channel, that is:

1 = llnnbb
2 = aabb
3 = tatabb
4 = bbbb

--type 

1: in clusters
2: point by point, 1507 points

================================================
The experimental input for the plots are in the folder:

1: /Resources/Limits/run2/nonRes-in-benchmarks
2: /Resources/Limits/run2/nonRes-in-1507-points

The limits there should be in fb. 

===============================================================
For type 1:

The approximations I do are:
- When limits in benchmarks in V3 are available, I extend them to clusters
- When limits in benchmarks in V1 are available, I take the worst one and extend it to all the points
- If not, I extend the SM limit to all the points
==============================================================
For type 2:

The approximations I do are:

- When limits in benchmarks in V1 are available, I take the worst one and extend it to all the points
- If not, I extend the SM limit to all the points
==============================================================

Those may not be so bad in some specific cases, we can learn somethings looking at them (with a careful eye!!!). 
Be conservative, and always assume that we are always being optimistic.
